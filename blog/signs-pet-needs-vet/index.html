      <p><strong>As a pet owner, knowing when your furry friend needs immediate medical attention can be the difference between life and death.</strong> While some symptoms can wait for a regular vet appointment, others require emergency care within hours or even minutes. This guide will help you recognize the critical warning signs and know exactly when to act.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Emergency vs. Non-Emergency Situations</h2>

      <p>Not every health concern requires a midnight trip to the emergency vet. Learning to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent symptoms helps you provide appropriate care while avoiding unnecessary stress and expense.</p>

      <p><strong>True emergencies</strong> involve symptoms that could lead to permanent damage or death within hours if left untreated. These require immediate veterinary attention, regardless of the time of day.</p>

      <p><strong>Non-emergencies</strong> are conditions that, while concerning, can typically wait for a regular veterinary appointment within 24-48 hours. Examples include minor limping, occasional vomiting (once or twice with no other symptoms), mild diarrhea, or minor cuts and scrapes.</p>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <div class="warning-box__title">When in Doubt, Call</div>
        <p>If you're unsure whether your pet's symptoms constitute an emergency, always err on the side of caution. A quick phone call to your vet or an emergency animal hospital can provide guidance and peace of mind.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>10 Warning Signs That Require Immediate Veterinary Care</h2>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">1</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Difficulty Breathing</h3>
        <p>Labored breathing, gasping, choking, or blue-tinged gums are life-threatening emergencies. Respiratory distress can indicate heart failure, allergic reactions, pneumonia, or airway obstruction. If your pet is struggling to breathe, every second counts. Keep them calm, avoid putting your fingers in their mouth, and get to an emergency vet immediately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">2</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Not Eating for 24+ Hours</h3>
        <p>While a missed meal occasionally is normal, refusing food for more than 24 hours (or 12 hours for puppies and kittens) signals a serious problem. This could indicate pain, infection, organ failure, or intestinal blockage. Cats are especially vulnerable as prolonged fasting can lead to hepatic lipidosis, a potentially fatal liver condition.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">3</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Excessive Vomiting or Diarrhea</h3>
        <p>Multiple episodes of vomiting or diarrhea within a few hours, especially if accompanied by blood, can quickly lead to severe dehydration. This is particularly dangerous for young, elderly, or small pets. Look for signs of dehydration: dry gums, sunken eyes, and skin that doesn't spring back when gently pinched.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">4</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Extreme Lethargy or Weakness</h3>
        <p>If your normally active pet suddenly becomes unresponsive, can't stand, or seems confused and disoriented, seek emergency care. Sudden weakness can indicate poisoning, internal bleeding, severe infection, low blood sugar, or heart problems. This is especially urgent if it comes on suddenly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">5</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Difficulty Urinating</h3>
        <p>Straining to urinate, producing only small amounts, crying while urinating, or not urinating at all is a medical emergency, especially in male cats. Urinary blockages can cause the bladder to rupture and lead to kidney failure within 24-48 hours. This condition is extremely painful and requires immediate intervention.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">6</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Swollen or Distended Abdomen</h3>
        <p>A visibly bloated belly, especially if your pet is restless, pacing, or attempting to vomit without producing anything, may indicate gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV or "bloat"). This condition, most common in large, deep-chested dogs, can be fatal within hours as the stomach twists and cuts off blood supply. Do not wait to seek treatment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">7</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Collapse or Fainting</h3>
        <p>If your pet suddenly collapses, loses consciousness, or faints, this indicates a serious underlying condition affecting the heart, brain, or blood pressure. Even if your pet seems to recover quickly, this warrants immediate veterinary evaluation to identify and treat the cause before a more severe episode occurs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">8</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Seizures</h3>
        <p>A seizure lasting more than 2-3 minutes, multiple seizures in quick succession, or a first-time seizure all require emergency care. During a seizure, keep your pet away from stairs and sharp objects, don't put anything in their mouth, and time the episode. Cluster seizures can cause brain damage and hyperthermia if not treated promptly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">9</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Eye Injuries</h3>
        <p>Any eye injury or sudden change in eye appearance requires urgent attention. Look for signs like squinting, excessive tearing, cloudiness, visible wounds, or bulging. Eye conditions can deteriorate rapidly, and delayed treatment may result in permanent vision loss. Keep your pet from pawing at the affected eye and seek care immediately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sign-card">
        <span class="sign-card__number">10</span>
        <h3 class="sign-card__title">Signs of Severe Pain</h3>
        <p>Pets instinctively hide pain, so when they show obvious signs of distress, the pain is usually severe. Watch for: crying or whimpering, aggression when touched, hunched posture, panting without exercise, trembling, or hiding. Severe pain could indicate fractures, internal injuries, pancreatitis, or other serious conditions requiring immediate treatment.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>When to Call vs. When to Go to Emergency</h2>

      <p>Understanding when a phone call suffices versus when you need to rush to the emergency room can save precious time in a crisis.</p>

      <h3>Call Your Vet First When:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Symptoms are mild and your pet is otherwise acting normally</li>
        <li>You need guidance on whether the situation is urgent</li>
        <li>Your regular vet is open and can see your pet soon</li>
        <li>You need advice on first aid while preparing to travel</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Go Directly to Emergency When:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your pet is unconscious, not breathing, or having a seizure</li>
        <li>There's obvious severe trauma or bleeding</li>
        <li>Your pet has ingested a known toxin</li>
        <li>Your pet is in obvious severe distress or pain</li>
        <li>It's after hours and symptoms are worsening</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <div class="tip-box__title">Pro Tip: Know Your Emergency Vet</div>
        <p>Save your nearest 24-hour emergency vet's address and phone number in your phone before an emergency happens. Precious minutes are lost when you're frantically searching for information during a crisis.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>How PetNudge AI Assistant Can Help</h2>

      <h2>Keep Health Records Handy</h2>

      <p>When you arrive at an emergency vet, having your pet's health history readily available can speed up diagnosis and treatment. Important information includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Current medications and dosages</li>
        <li>Known allergies or sensitivities</li>
        <li>Previous surgeries or major health conditions</li>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>Your instincts as a pet owner matter. You know your pet better than anyone, and if something feels wrong, trust that feeling. It's always better to have a veterinarian confirm that everything is fine than to wait and risk a treatable condition becoming life-threatening.</p>

      <p>Keep this guide bookmarked for quick reference, maintain an up-to-date emergency kit for your pet, and always know the location of your nearest 24-hour veterinary hospital. With preparation and knowledge, you'll be ready to give your pet the best chance in any health emergency.</p>
